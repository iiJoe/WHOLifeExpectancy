# WHOLifeExpectancy

## About
This repository is a Mini-Project which focuses on the Life Expectancy. 
The data set is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who).
The data reflects reflects the different life expectancy of countries, with a range of indicators, from a period of 2000 to 2015.
The original source of this data set is obtained from the data repository under World Health Organization (WHO). 
A video presentation about this project can also be found on Youtube

## Problem statement
Life Expectancy is a key metric for assessing a country's population health.
We would like to seek to improve the overall populations health of a given country. 
As such, we want to figure out what are the most significant factors that impact life expectancy and to build a model that would be able to predict life expectancy. 

## Models used 
1. Multivariate Linear Regression
2. XGBoost

## New things we learnt from this project
1. Using plotly as a new form of visualisation
2. Using Feasture selection to identify key variables
3. Cross validation
4. XGBoost

## Conclusion
We managed to find the more significant factors and built accurate models to predict life expectancy.
One interesting thing was that schooling, or in other words, the amount of education received by individuals turned out to be a more significant factor compared to vaccinations and immunisations.
Countries should focus more on the key factors identified to improve the life expectancy of citizens, increasing the overall population health of the country.
